Forced Landing In Gravitationally Hostile Terrrain

What is This?
This is a low-budget-experimental-couch-coop-multiplayer game made in Unreal Engine 4. It is based on the original Moonlander (or Lunar Lander)
made in the early days of gaming in 1979, it could be played on the Atari. You can try a faithful recreation of the original here

How Low Budget?
If you played the game from our itch.io page https://red-dog95.itch.io/flight, you probably noticed the low-budgetness. 
In fact, we've spent $0 throughout the entire 2-month production timeline. All the assets, art and UI have been created from scratch
in 64+ days, with the exception of several free content packs from the Unreal Marketplace.

Why is it Experimental?
This is not experimental in the sense that it contains something "never seen before", it is experimental because we wanted to prove that
a game could be made without spending a dime. As all our assets are created with already free and available software, and our spare time is donated.
Unfortnunately I'm not a good artist, so a lot of our textures are simple. But simple in Unreal Engine looks much worse than we expected.

When will it be done?
The game is currently in a pre-alpha state, though we have scheduled the launch of the alpha version to be soon. It will feature many updates
and improvements. But we feel that it's simplicity doesn't require a huge addition of content. So our primary goal is polish. We want 
to make the game enjoyable for a couple friends for a few minutes, maybe up to an hour.
